# C++ Matrix Library for Neural Networks
 A Mathematics Matrices Library designed in modern C++ for better readability, speed, and robustness. This library is optimized for the development of neural network frameworks, ensuring no memory leaks. It is the sequel to my CMatrixLibrary repository.


Notes:
a) std::copy is a standard library algorithm in C++ that copies a range of elements from one location to another. The function takes three iterators: the first two specify the source range (begin and end), and the third specifies the destination where the elements should be copied.

b) When dealing with temporary objects that are about to go out of scope, moving them can avoid unnecessary copies.
